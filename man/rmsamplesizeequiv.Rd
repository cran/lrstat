\arguments{
\item{beta}{The type II error.}

\item{kMax}{The maximum number of stages.}

\item{informationRates}{The information rates.
Defaults to \code{(1:kMax) / kMax} if left unspecified.}

\item{criticalValues}{Upper boundaries on the z-test statistic scale
for stopping for efficacy.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for each of the two one-sided
tests. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{typeAlphaSpending}{The type of alpha spending. One of the following:
"OF" for O'Brien-Fleming boundaries, "P" for Pocock boundaries,
"WT" for Wang & Tsiatis boundaries, "sfOF" for O'Brien-Fleming type
spending function, "sfP" for Pocock type spending function,
"sfKD" for Kim & DeMets spending function, "sfHSD" for Hwang,
Shi & DeCani spending function, "user" for user defined spending,
and "none" for no early efficacy stopping. Defaults to "sfOF".}

\item{parameterAlphaSpending}{The parameter value for the alpha spending.
Corresponds to Delta for "WT", rho for "sfKD", and gamma for "sfHSD".}

\item{userAlphaSpending}{The user defined alpha spending. Cumulative alpha
spent up to each stage.}

\item{milestone}{The milestone time at which to calculate the
restricted mean survival time.}

\item{rmstDiffLower}{The lower equivalence limit of restricted mean
survival time difference.}

\item{rmstDiffUpper}{The upper equivalence limit of restricted mean
survival time difference.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{Allocation ratio for the active treatment
versus control. Defaults to 1 for equal randomization.}

\item{accrualTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise Poisson enrollment time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 3)} breaks the time axis into 2 accrual intervals:
[0, 3) and [3, Inf).}

\item{accrualIntensity}{A vector of accrual intensities. One for
each accrual time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{stratumFraction}{A vector of stratum fractions that sum to 1.
Defaults to 1 for no stratification.}

\item{lambda1}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{lambda2}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the control group.}

\item{gamma1}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{gamma2}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the control group.}

\item{accrualDuration}{Duration of the enrollment period.}

\item{followupTime}{Follow-up time for the last enrolled subject.}

\item{fixedFollowup}{Whether a fixed follow-up design is used.
Defaults to 0 for variable follow-up.}

\item{interval}{The interval to search for the solution of
accrualDuration, followupDuration, or the proportionality constant
of accrualIntensity. Defaults to \code{c(0.001, 240)}.}

\item{spendingTime}{A vector of length \code{kMax} for the error spending
time at each analysis. Defaults to missing, in which case, it is the
same as \code{informationRates}.}

\item{rounding}{Whether to round up sample size.
Defaults to 1 for sample size rounding.}
