\value{
An S3 class \code{designOneMultinom} object with the following
components:
\itemize{

\description{
Obtains the power given sample size or obtains the sample
size given power for one-sample multinomial response.
}
\details{
A single-arm multinomial response design is used to test whether the
prevalence of each category is different from the null hypothesis
prevalence.
The null hypothesis is that the prevalence of each category
is equal to \eqn{\pi_{0i}}, while the alternative hypothesis is that
the prevalence of each category is equal to \eqn{\pi_i}, for
\eqn{i=1,\ldots,C}, where \eqn{C} is the number of categories.

The sample size is calculated based on the chi-square test for
multinomial response. The test statistic is given by
\deqn{X^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{C} \frac{(n_i - n\pi_{0i})^2}{n\pi_{0i}}}
where \eqn{n_i} is the number of subjects in category \eqn{i}, and
\eqn{n} is the total sample size.
\itemize{
\item Under the null hypothesis, \eqn{X^2} follows a chi-square distribution
with \eqn{C-1} degrees of freedom.
\item Under the alternative hypothesis, \eqn{X^2} follows a non-central
chi-square distribution with non-centrality parameter
\deqn{\lambda = n \sum_{i=1}^{C} \frac{(\pi_i - \pi_{0i})^2}{\pi_{0i}}}
}

The sample size is chosen such that the power to reject the null
hypothesis is at least \eqn{1-\beta} for a given
significance level \eqn{\alpha}.
