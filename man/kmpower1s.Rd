\arguments{
\item{kMax}{The maximum number of stages.}

\item{informationRates}{The information rates.
Defaults to \code{(1:kMax) / kMax} if left unspecified.}

\item{efficacyStopping}{Indicators of whether efficacy stopping is allowed
at each stage. Defaults to true if left unspecified.}

\item{futilityStopping}{Indicators of whether futility stopping is allowed
at each stage. Defaults to true if left unspecified.}

\item{criticalValues}{Upper boundaries on the z-test statistic scale
for stopping for efficacy.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level. Defaults to 0.025.}

\item{typeAlphaSpending}{The type of alpha spending. One of the following:
"OF" for O'Brien-Fleming boundaries, "P" for Pocock boundaries,
"WT" for Wang & Tsiatis boundaries, "sfOF" for O'Brien-Fleming type
spending function, "sfP" for Pocock type spending function,
"sfKD" for Kim & DeMets spending function, "sfHSD" for Hwang,
Shi & DeCani spending function, "user" for user defined spending,
and "none" for no early efficacy stopping. Defaults to "sfOF".}

\item{parameterAlphaSpending}{The parameter value for the alpha spending.
Corresponds to Delta for "WT", rho for "sfKD", and gamma for "sfHSD".}

\item{userAlphaSpending}{The user defined alpha spending. Cumulative alpha
spent up to each stage.}

\item{futilityBounds}{Lower boundaries on the z-test statistic scale
for stopping for futility at stages 1, ..., \code{kMax-1}. Defaults to
\code{rep(-6, kMax-1)} if left unspecified. The futility bounds are
non-binding for the calculation of critical values.}

\item{typeBetaSpending}{The type of beta spending. One of the following:
"sfOF" for O'Brien-Fleming type spending function, "sfP" for Pocock
type spending function, "sfKD" for Kim & DeMets spending function,
"sfHSD" for Hwang, Shi & DeCani spending function, and "none" for no
early futility stopping. Defaults to "none".}

\item{parameterBetaSpending}{The parameter value for the beta spending.
Corresponds to rho for "sfKD", and gamma for "sfHSD".}

\item{milestone}{The milestone time at which to calculate the survival
probability.}

\item{survH0}{The milestone survival probability under the null
hypothesis.}

\item{accrualTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise Poisson enrollment time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 3)} breaks the time axis into 2 accrual intervals:
[0, 3) and [3, Inf).}

\item{accrualIntensity}{A vector of accrual intensities. One for
each accrual time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{stratumFraction}{A vector of stratum fractions that sum to 1.
Defaults to 1 for no stratification.}

\item{lambda}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{gamma}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout or a vector of
hazard rates for piecewise exponential dropout. Defaults to 0 for
no dropout.}

\item{accrualDuration}{Duration of the enrollment period.}

\item{followupTime}{Follow-up time for the last enrolled subject.}

\item{fixedFollowup}{Whether a fixed follow-up design is used.
Defaults to 0 for variable follow-up.}

\item{spendingTime}{A vector of length \code{kMax} for the error spending
time at each analysis. Defaults to missing, in which case, it is the
same as \code{informationRates}.}

\item{studyDuration}{Study duration for fixed follow-up design.
Defaults to missing, which is to be replaced with the sum of
\code{accrualDuration} and \code{followupTime}. If provided,
the value is allowed to be less than the sum of \code{accrualDuration}
and \code{followupTime}.}
