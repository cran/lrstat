\arguments{
\item{time}{A vector of calendar times at which to calculate the
restricted mean survival time.}

\item{milestone}{The milestone time at which to calculate the
restricted mean survival time.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{Allocation ratio for the active treatment
versus control. Defaults to 1 for equal randomization.}

\item{accrualTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise Poisson enrollment time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 3)} breaks the time axis into 2 accrual intervals:
[0, 3) and [3, Inf).}

\item{accrualIntensity}{A vector of accrual intensities. One for
each accrual time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{stratumFraction}{A vector of stratum fractions that sum to 1.
Defaults to 1 for no stratification.}

\item{lambda1}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{lambda2}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the control group.}

\item{gamma1}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{gamma2}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the control group.}

\item{accrualDuration}{Duration of the enrollment period.}

\item{followupTime}{Follow-up time for the last enrolled subject.}

\item{fixedFollowup}{Whether a fixed follow-up design is used.
Defaults to 0 for variable follow-up.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: The calendar time at which to calculate the restricted
mean survival time.
\item \code{subjects}: The number of enrolled subjects.
\item \code{milestone}: The milestone time relative to randomization.
\item \code{rmst1}: The restricted mean survival time for the treatment

\item \code{rmst2}: The restricted mean survival time for the control group.
\item \code{rmstDiff}: The difference in restricted mean survival times,
i.e., \code{rmst1 - rmst2}.

\item \code{vrmst2}: The variance for \code{rmst2}.
\item \code{vrmstDiff}: The variance for \code{rmstDiff}.
\item \code{information}: The information for \code{rmstDiff}, equal to
\code{1/vrmstDiff}.
\item \code{rmstDiffZ}: The Z-statistic value, i.e.,
\code{rmstDiff/sqrt(vrmstDiff)}.
