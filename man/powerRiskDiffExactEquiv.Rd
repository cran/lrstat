if requested.
\item \code{power}: The power.
\item \code{n}: The sample size.
\item \code{riskDiffLower}: The lower equivalence limit of risk difference.
\item \code{riskDiffUpper}: The upper equivalence limit of risk difference.
\item \code{pi1}: The assumed probability for the active treatment group.
\item \code{pi2}: The assumed probability for the control group.
\item \code{riskDiff}: The risk difference.
