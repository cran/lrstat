\arguments{
\item{n}{The total sample size.}

\item{riskDiffLower}{The lower equivalence limit of risk difference.}

\item{riskDiffUpper}{The upper equivalence limit of risk difference.}

\item{pi1}{The assumed probability for the active treatment group.}

\item{pi2}{The assumed probability for the control group.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{Allocation ratio for the active treatment
versus control. Defaults to 1 for equal randomization.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for each of the two one-sided
tests. Defaults to 0.05.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{alpha}: The specified significance level for each of the two
one-sided tests.
\item \code{attainedAlpha}: The attained significance level.
\item \code{power}: The power.
\item \code{n}: The sample size.
\item \code{riskDiffLower}: The lower equivalence limit of risk difference.
\item \code{riskDiffUpper}: The upper equivalence limit of risk difference.
\item \code{pi1}: The assumed probability for the active treatment group.
\item \code{pi2}: The assumed probability for the control group.
\item \code{riskDiff}: The risk difference.
\item \code{allocationRatioPlanned}: Allocation ratio for the active
treatment versus control.
\item \code{zstatRiskDiffLower}: The efficacy boundaries on the
z-test statistic scale for the one-sided null hypothesis on the
lower equivalence limit.
\item \code{zstatRiskDiffUpper}: The efficacy boundaries on the
z-test statistic scale for the one-sided null hypothesis on the
upper equivalence limit.
