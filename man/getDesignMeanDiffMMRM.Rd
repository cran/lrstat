\details{
Consider a longitudinal study with two treatment groups.
The outcome is measured at baseline and at \eqn{k} postbaseline
time points. For each treatment group, the outcomes are assumed to
follow a multivariate normal distribution.
Conditional on baseline, the covariance matrix of the post-baseline
outcomes is denoted by \eqn{\Sigma_1} for the active treatment group
and \eqn{\Sigma_2} for the control group.
Let \eqn{\mu_1} and \eqn{\mu_2} denote the mean vectors of
post-baseline outcomes for the active and control groups, respectively.
We are interested in testing the null
hypothesis \eqn{H_0: \mu_{1,k} - \mu_{2,k} = \delta_0}
against the alternative \eqn{H_1: \mu_{1,k} - \mu_{2,k} = \delta}.

The study design is based on the information for treatment difference
at the last postbaseline time point. This information is given by
\deqn{I = 1/\text{Var}(\hat{\mu}_{1,k} - \hat{\mu}_{2,k})}
In the presence of monotone missing data, let
\eqn{p_{g,1},\ldots,p_{g,k}} denote the proportions of subjects in
observed data patterns 1 through \eqn{k} for treatment group
\eqn{g=1} (active) or 2 (control).
A subject in pattern \eqn{j} has complete data up to time \eqn{t_j}, i.e.,
the observed outcomes are \eqn{y_{i,1},\ldots,y_{i,j}},
with missing values for \eqn{y_{i,j+1},\ldots,y_{i,k}}.

According to Lu et al. (2008), the information
matrix for the post-baseline mean vector in group \eqn{g} is
\deqn{I_g = n \pi_g J_g}
where \eqn{\pi_g} is the proportion of subjects in group \eqn{g},
and \deqn{J_g = \sum_{j=1}^k p_{g,j} \left(
\begin{array}{cc} \Sigma_{g,j}^{-1} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)}
Here, \eqn{\Sigma_{g,j}} is the leading \eqn{j\times j}
principal submatrix of \eqn{\Sigma_g}. It follows that
\deqn{\text{Var}(\hat{\mu}_{1,k} - \hat{\mu}_{2,k}) =
\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{1}{\pi_1} J_1^{-1}[k,k] +
\frac{1}{\pi_2} J_2^{-1}[k,k]\right)}

The observed data pattern probabilities depend on the accrual and
dropout distributions.
Let \eqn{H(u)} denote the cumulative distribution function of
enrollment time \eqn{u},
\eqn{G_g(t)} denote the survival function of dropout time \eqn{t} for
treatment group \eqn{g},
and \eqn{\tau} denote the calendar time at interim or final analysis.
Then, for \eqn{j=1,\ldots,k-1}, the probability that a subject in group
\eqn{g} falls into observed data pattern \eqn{j} is
\deqn{p_{g,j} = H(\tau - t_j)G_g(t_j) - H(\tau - t_{j+1})G_g(t_{j+1})}
For the last pattern (\eqn{j=k}, i.e., completers),
\deqn{p_{g,k} = H(\tau - t_k)G_g(t_k)}
For the final analysis, \eqn{\tau} is the study duration,
so \eqn{H(\tau - t_j) = 1} for all \eqn{j}.
Therefore, the pattern probabilities depend only on the dropout
distribution:
\deqn{p_{g,j} = G_g(t_j) - G_g(t_{j+1}), \quad j=1,\ldots,k-1}
and \deqn{p_{g,k} = G_g(t_k)}

Cumulative dropout probabilities at post-baseline time points
can be used to define a piecewise exponential dropout distribution.
Let \eqn{F_g(t_j)} denote the cumulative probability of dropout
by time \eqn{t_j} for treatment group \eqn{g}.
The left endpoints of the piecewise survival time intervals are given by
\eqn{t_0=0,t_1,\ldots,t_{k-1}}.
The hazard rate in the interval \eqn{(t_{j-1},t_j]} is given by
\deqn{\gamma_{g,j} = -\log\left(\frac{1 - F_g(t_j)}{1 - F_g(t_{j-1})}
\right) / (t_j - t_{j-1}), \quad j=1,\ldots,k}
