\description{
Obtains the power given sample size or obtains the sample
size given power for difference in two-sample multinomial responses.
}
\details{
A two-arm multinomial response design is used to test whether the
prevalence of each category differs between two treatment arms.
Let \eqn{\pi_{gi}} denote the prevalence of category \eqn{i}
in group \eqn{g}, where \eqn{g=1} for the treatment group and
\eqn{g=2} for the control group.
The chi-square test statistic is given by
\deqn{X^2 = \sum_{g=1}^{2} \sum_{i=1}^{C}
\frac{(n_{gi} - n_{g+} n_{+i}/n)^2}{n_{g+} n_{+i}/n}}
where \eqn{n_{gi}} is the number of subjects in category \eqn{i}
for group \eqn{g}, \eqn{n_{g+}} is the total number of subjects
in group \eqn{g}, and \eqn{n_{+i}} is the total number of subjects
in category \eqn{i} across both groups, and
\eqn{n} is the total sample size.
\itemize{
\item Under the null hypothesis, \eqn{X^2} follows a chi-square distribution
with \eqn{C-1} degrees of freedom.
\item Under the alternative hypothesis, \eqn{X^2} follows a non-central
chi-square distribution with non-centrality parameter
\deqn{\lambda = n r (1-r) \sum_{i=1}^{C} \frac{(\pi_{1i} - \pi_{2i})^2}
  {r \pi_{1i} + (1-r)\pi_{2i}}}
where \eqn{r} is the randomization probability for the active treatment.
}

The sample size is chosen such that the power to reject the null
hypothesis is at least \eqn{1-\beta} for a given
significance level \eqn{\alpha}.
