\description{
Obtains the power given sample size or obtains the sample
size given power for the chi-square test for unordered multi-sample
multinomial response.
}
\details{
A multi-sample multinomial response design is used to test whether the
response probabilities differ among multiple treatment arms.
Let \eqn{\pi_{gi}} denote the response probability for
category \eqn{i = 1,\ldots,C} in group
\eqn{g = 1,\ldots,G}, where \eqn{G} is the total number of
treatment groups, and \eqn{C} is the total number of categories
for the response variable.

The chi-square test statistic is given by
\deqn{X^2 = \sum_{g=1}^{G} \sum_{i=1}^{C}
\frac{(n_{gi} - n_{g+}n_{+i}/n)^2}{n_{g+} n_{+i}/n}}
where \eqn{n_{gi}} is the number of subjects in category \eqn{i}
for group \eqn{g}, \eqn{n_{g+}} is the total number of subjects
in group \eqn{g}, and \eqn{n_{+i}} is the total number of subjects
in category \eqn{i} across all groups, and
\eqn{n} is the total sample size.

Let \eqn{r_g} denote the randomization probability for group \eqn{g}, and
define the weighted average response probability
for category \eqn{i} across all groups as
\deqn{\bar{\pi_i} = \sum_{g=1}^{G} r_g \pi_{gi}}
\itemize{
\item Under the null hypothesis, \eqn{X^2} follows a chi-square distribution
with \eqn{(G-1)(C-1)} degrees of freedom.
\item Under the alternative hypothesis, \eqn{X^2} follows a non-central
chi-square distribution with non-centrality parameter
\deqn{\lambda = n \sum_{g=1}^{G} \sum_{i=1}^{C}
  \frac{r_g (\pi_{gi} - \bar{\pi_i})^2}
  {\bar{\pi_i}}}
}

The sample size is chosen such that the power to reject the null
hypothesis is at least \eqn{1-\beta} for a given
significance level \eqn{\alpha}.
