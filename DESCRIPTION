Description: Performs power and sample size calculation for non-proportional hazards model using the Fleming-Harrington family of weighted log-rank tests. The sequentially calculated log-rank test score statistics are assumed to have independent increments as characterized in Anastasios A. Tsiatis (1982) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1982.10477898>. The mean and variance of log-rank test score statistics are calculated based on Edward Lakatos (1986) <doi:10.1016/0197-2456(86)90047-4> and Kaifeng Lu (2021) <doi:10.1002/pst.2069>. The boundary crossing probabilities are calculated using the recursive integration algorithm described in Christopher Jennison and Bruce W. Turnbull (2000, ISBN:0849303168).
